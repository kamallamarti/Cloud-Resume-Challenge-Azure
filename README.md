# Azure Cloud Resume Challenge

Welcome to my Cloud Resume Challenge for Azure project! ☁️
I'm participating in the Azure Cloud Resume Challenge, where I'm sharing my experience of creating
a dynamic resume hosted in the cloud.

## What is Cloud Resume Challenge?

Imagine [The Cloud Resume Challenge](https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/) as a hilarious obstacle course for your resume, designed to flex and show off your Cloud skills! Our guide through this amusement park of tech antics? None other than the genius **Forrest Brazeal**.

## Overview

I initially wanted to break the monotony of studying by diving into projects to showcase my skills. In 2023, I declared it my upskilling year, focusing mainly on Cloud. I kicked things off with the fundamentals, earning the AZ-900. With AI sparking my interest, I grabbed the AI-900 badge and delved deeper into Azure Cloud, conquering the AZ-104.

After a well-deserved break, I committed to the Cloud Resume Challenge to apply my skillset. I'm jazzing up my portfolio site to showcase projects more creatively, adding a snazzy resume page for the Challenge.

This [site](https://kamallamarti.com/), capturing my journey, will call Azure its home, and the [blog](https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/) will be my tell-all on progress and challenges.


The sources of information utilized to meet this challenge were:

- Microsoft documentations
- Chat GPT
- A collection of videos from YouTube *University*, including one titled [ACG Projects: Build Your Resume on Azure with Blob Storage, Functions, CosmosDB, and GitHub Actions](https://youtu.be/ieYrBWmkfno?si=wf3mU-RwmzEosM97)
